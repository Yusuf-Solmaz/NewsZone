<!-- Architecture -->
## Architecture
This Android app uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern and Clean Architecture principles, organized into four main modules for better scalability and maintainability.

MVVM

- Model: Manages data and business logic, separate from the UI.
- View: Displays the data and interacts with the user.
- ViewModel: Connects the View and Model, handling UI-related logic and state management.

Clean Architecture & Multi Module
- App Module: The core module that integrates all other modules and provides the main entry point of the application.
- Data Module: Handles data sources, such as APIs and databases, and provides data to the Domain Layer.
- Domain Module: Contains the core business logic and use cases, which are independent of external frameworks.
- Presentation (Feature) Module: Encapsulates the app's features, allowing for modular development and testing of individual functionalities.
